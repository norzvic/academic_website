My name is Ke Nie [[IPA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help:IPA): kʰɤ njɛ], and I am a [Ph.D. candidate in sociology](http://sociology.ucsd.edu/people/graduate-students/ke-nie.html) at the University of California, San Diego, with a [Specialization in Computational Social Science](https://css.ucsd.edu/phd-specialization/index.html). I am a cultural and economic sociologist who uses computational methods, among others, to study culture, creativity, and classification.

My research focuses on what I call "the political economy of cultural creativity," investigating how cultural creativity is shaped by economic incentives and political interventions. My recent works primarily utilize computational tools to find better ways of measuring creativity and its change. For example, my [award-winning](https://citams.org/citasa-awards/) article published in __*Poetics*__ uses Music Information Retrieval (MIR), neural networks, and topic modeling algorithms to study [how censorship reshaped music genres in China](/posts/hiphop_censorship_computational/). In a similar vein, another article of mine, published in __*Chinese Sociological Review*__, reveals [how artistic innovation is curbed by monetization programs](/posts/monetization_novelty/).

Building upon these works, my dissertation project examines how creativity is organized, regulated, and practiced in the Chinese popular music industry in the wake of its extensive digitization. The project is funded by American Sociological Association Doctoral Dissertation Research Improvement Grant ([ASA DDRIG](https://www.asanet.org/academic-professional-resources/asa-grants-and-fellowships/asa-doctoral-dissertation-research-improvement-grants-asa-ddrig/2022-recipients)) and [Chiang Ching-kuo Foundation](http://www.cckf.org/en/news/2022052303), among others, and it was awarded the Honorable Mention for the Geoffrey Tootell Mathematical Sociology Outstanding Dissertation-in-Progress Award at the American Sociological Association.

In summer 2022, I started my internship at Tencent America as a Data Scientist, primarily researching and applying network experimentation methods in support of Tencent Games. Before joining the doctoral program at UCSD, I worked as a news correspondent and later a freelance author in China, writing for [Xinhua](http://www.xinhuanet.com/politics/2015-05/18/c_1115322749.htm), [Caixin Weekly](http://weekly.caixin.com/2017-03-17/101067187.html), [The Paper](https://www.thepaper.cn/newsDetail_forward_1728357), [The Initium](https://theinitium.com/article/20210103-opinion-fou-tsong/), [CNPolitics](http://cnpolitics.org/), and many other renowned media platforms. In my spare time, I also [write and produce music](https://soundcloud.com/keniejimiproject/) for music videos, commercials, and for fun.
