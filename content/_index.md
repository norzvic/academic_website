Hi, my name is Ke Nie and I am a [doctoral candidate in sociology at the University of California, San Diego](https://sociology.ucsd.edu/people/graduate-students/ke-nie.html). I use both quantitative and qualitative methods to study cultural markets and cultural policies around the world with a specific focus on music. For example, my recent work uses Music Information Retrieval (MIR) algorithms and topic models to investigate [how censorship impacted music production in China](/posts/hiphop_censorship_computational/). I am now focusing on my dissertation project, which examines how diversity and creativity in music production in the US, Japan, China, and other nations have been affected by the digitization of the music industry. 

Before joining the doctoral program at UCSD, I worked as a news correspondant and later a freelance writer in China, writing for [Xinhua](http://www.xinhuanet.com/), [Caixin Weekly](http://weekly.caixin.com/), [The Paper](http://thepaper.cn/), [The Initium](http://theinitium.com/), [CNPolitics](http://cnpolitics.org/), and many other renowned media platforms. In my spare time, I also [write and produce music for music videos, commercials, and fun](https://soundcloud.com/keniejimiproject/).

Feel free to reach out to me at knie[at]ucsd.edu.
