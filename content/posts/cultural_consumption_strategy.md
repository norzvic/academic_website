### Cultural consumption as compensatory strategy of cultural capital: Evidence from China

#### Ke Nie, Department of Sociology, University of California, San Diego

Extensive research of economic sociology and social psychology shows that consumption is responsive to future risk in general, and consumption for cultural goods is the most among other types. According to the theory of social reproduction, people with higher cultural capital are more inclined to raise their cultural consumption. In this paper, I test the theory using empirical evidence from China, a country that has been experiencing an outstanding growth of cultural consumption recently. I use quantitative methods to investigate the most recent data of Chinese General Social Survey (CGSS). The results suggest that the enrollment of private medical insurance is positively influencing cultural consumption at the family level, whilst the impact of state-fund insurances or private pension system on cultural consumption is statistically insignificant. Results also show that people with lower cultural capital are more responsive to their enrollment in private medical insurance as they increase their cultural consumption most significantly among others. While my findings here support the previous research on the high-responsiveness of cultural consumption towards future risk, they challenge the theory of social reproduction, implicating a "compensatory" rather than a "reproductive" strategy in the social practices.
